# STIB’s Quality of Service Assessment

## Intro to the Problem

STIB (public transport company in Brussels) operates a complex network of around 650km:
-4 metro lines
-17 tram lines
-55 bus lines
-11 night bus lines
Everyday it provides transport to 1,2 million people. Given this complexity and relevance, a proper assessment of the quality of the service is important, using relevant techniques and metrics of the world of  public transportation. Given the open data source APIs STIB provides, https://data.stib-mivb.brussels/pages/home/, one can perform the analysis.

The below analysis was done in the spirif of the Data Mining course from the Specialized Master in data science, Big data curcciulum, from ULB.
